# QuantumDocker
This project is intended for quick and automated quantum software setup. For beginners, it will be extremely easy to build and access your own quantum environment.


Current version supports automatic installation of the latest QPanda (developed by OriginQuantum) and Qiskit (developed by IBM). These installation will not affect your own environment and runs much easier and faster than a virtual machine.
